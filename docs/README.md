# Documentation

## Overview

I created a series of scripts to help automate the repetitive tasks of building,
downloading, and cleaning the project. You can do whatever you want though.

## Building

Taken straight from the Flatpak flatpak-builder docs, just run the shell script:

```bash
bash scripts/build.sh
```

What this does is download the requirements, then perform a clean build.
